BoilerMaster-Web
================

Web interface for boilermaster project. As the boilermaster project is heavily based on the PiThermostat project by tommybobbins so is this interface.

The original interface was written in Python Django, whereas this is PHP and Javascript. The reason behind this version was to compare performance of the two.

Speed/lightweightness is essential to this project as it the whole thing is designed to sit on a Raspberry Pi.
